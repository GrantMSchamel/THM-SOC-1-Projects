## Introduction: A Mother's Plea  
A distressed call led me to investigate a ransomware attack on a personal computer. Your mother Sophie, had unknowingly downloaded and executed a malicious installer. After noticing encrypted files and a ransom note on her desktop, she reached out for help. By the time I arrived, the ransom note had been replaced with a message to check a Bitcoin wallet. My task was to uncover what happened and ensure the computer's security.
