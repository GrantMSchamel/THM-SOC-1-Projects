## üîç Investigation Questions and Answers  

### 1. What is a technique used by the APT to both perform recon and gain initial access?  
**Answer:** Spearphishing link  
- **Details:**  
  - This technique is used to gather reconnaissance on employees through phishing emails and gain initial access when a user clicks the malicious link.

### 4. If the above technique was successful, which scripting interpreters should Sunny search for to identify successful execution?  
**Answer:** Powershell and Windows Command Shell  
- **Details:**  
  - APT28 is likely to use these scripting interpreters to gain deeper access and execute commands on the compromised systems.

### 5. Which registry keys should Sunny observe to track persistence changes made by obfuscated scripts?  
**Answer:** Registry Run Keys  
- **Details:**  
  - Registry Run Keys allow malicious scripts to copy themselves into the startup directory, enabling persistence on the machine.

### 6. Which system binary's execution should Sunny scrutinize for proxy execution?  
**Answer:** Rundll32  
- **Details:**  
  - This Windows binary is used to execute DLLs containing executable code, enabling APT28 to hide malicious commands and evade detection.

### 7. Which technique might the APT be using when Sunny identified `tcpdump` on a compromised host?  
**Answer:** Network Sniffing  
- **Details:**  
  - `tcpdump` is a tool for capturing and analyzing network traffic, used by APT28 to discover sensitive data and network activity.

### 8. Which remote services should Sunny observe to identify APT activity traces?  
**Answer:** SMB/Windows Admin Shares  
- **Details:**  
  - APT28 may exploit these services to move laterally and gain administrative access to remote systems.  
  - Reference: [T1021.002 - SMB/Windows Admin Shares](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/002/)

### 9. Which information repository is the likely target for intellectual property theft?  
**Answer:** SharePoint  
- **Details:**  
  - SharePoint is used by companies to store sensitive information, making it a prime target for APT28's intellectual property theft operations.

### 10. What types of proxy might the APT use for data exfiltration?  
**Answer:** External Proxy and Multi-hop Proxy  
- **Details:**  
  - **External Proxy:** Used to retrieve data without a direct internet connection, often through port redirection or cloud-based resources.  
  - **Multi-hop Proxy:** Routes traffic through multiple servers to encrypt data and hide the IP, increasing anonymity and evasion.

## üß† Key Takeaways  

- Proactively monitoring phishing techniques and user accounts is critical in mitigating initial access attempts.  
- Registry Run Keys and system binaries like `Rundll32` can serve as indicators of persistence and proxy execution tactics.  
- Tools like `tcpdump` and remote services exploitation (e.g., SMB/Windows Admin Shares) are crucial areas to scrutinize during lateral movement investigations.
