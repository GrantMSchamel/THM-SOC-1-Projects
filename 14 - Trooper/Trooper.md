# Trooper - Portfolio Project  

## Introduction: Threat Intelligence Analysis  
As a Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) analyst, I conducted an investigation to identify the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) employed by a threat group targeting a multinational technology company. Leveraging platforms such as OpenCTI and the MITRE ATT&CK Navigator, I gathered actionable insights into the adversary‚Äôs identity, malware, and attack methods.  

This project showcases my ability to use threat intelligence platforms and frameworks to identify and map advanced persistent threats (APTs).

## Questions to Investigate and Answers  

### 1. **What kind of phishing campaign does APT X use as part of their TTPs?**  
- **Answer:** Spear-phishing attacks  
  - By analyzing the provided threat advisory report, I identified that the group employs spear-phishing techniques to target victims, a common method for obtaining initial access.

### 2. **What is the name of the malware used by APT X?**  
- **Answer:** USBferry  
  - Searching for APT X in OpenCTI provided a link to the malware associated with this threat group. The name USBferry was listed under the arsenal of tools used by the adversary.

### 3. **What is the malware's STIX ID?**  
- **Answer:** `malware--5d0ea014-1ce9-5d5c-bcc7-f625a07907d0`  
  - In OpenCTI, I navigated to the USBferry malware profile. The STIX ID was displayed under the basic information section for the malware.

### 4. **With the use of a USB, what technique did APT X use for initial access?**  
- **Answer:** Replication Through Removable Media  
  - By reviewing the advisory report and analyzing APT X‚Äôs methods in OpenCTI, I identified the use of USB devices to propagate malware in air-gapped environments. Cross-referencing this behavior in the MITRE ATT&CK framework pointed to this specific technique.
