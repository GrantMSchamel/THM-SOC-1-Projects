# Investigating with Splunk

## Scenario
SOC Analyst Johny has observed some anomalous behaviors in the logs of a few Windows machines. It looks like the adversary has access to some of these machines and successfully created a backdoor. His manager has asked him to pull those logs from suspected hosts and ingest them into Splunk for quick investigation. Our task as a SOC Analyst is to examine the logs and identify the anomalies.

## üîç Investigation Questions and Answers

### 1. **How many events were collected and ingested in the index main?**
**Answer:** 12,256  
- **Steps Taken:**  
  - I opened the Splunk enterprise app and used the search query `index=main`. From the results, I determined that **12,256** events were collected and ingested.

### 2. **On one of the infected hosts, the adversary was successful in creating a backdoor user. What is the new username?**
**Answer:** A1berto  
- **Steps Taken:**  
  - I filtered by the host "server" and found the event code "4720," which corresponds to user creation. I examined the event details to find that the new username was **A1berto**.

### 3. **On the same host, a registry key was also updated regarding the new backdoor user. What is the full path of that registry key?**
**Answer:** `HKLM\SAM\SAM\Domains\Account\Users\Names\A1berto\`  
- **Steps Taken:**  
  - I searched the logs using the new username "A1berto" and looked for EventID 13, which logs registry value changes `index=main EventID="13" "A1berto"`. I found the full path of the registry key in the details.

### 4. **Examine the logs and identify the user that the adversary was trying to impersonate.**
**Answer:** Alberto  
- **Steps Taken:**  
  - By examining the "User" field in the logs, I found that the adversary was likely trying to impersonate **Alberto**, as the name appeared correctly in the logs.

### 5. **What is the command used to add a backdoor user from a remote computer?**
**Answer:**  
`"C:\windows\System32\Wbem\WMIC.exe" /node:WORKSTATION6 process call create "net user /add A1berto paw0rd1"`  
- **Steps Taken:**  
  - I searched the `index=main` logs for commands in the "CommandLine" field and found that the adversary used the above command to add the backdoor user.

### 6. **How many times was the login attempt from the backdoor user observed during the investigation?**
**Answer:** 0  
- **Steps Taken:**  
  - Using the search query `index=main A1berto`, I could not find any login attempts from the backdoor user. Similarly, searching with `index=main User="A1berto"` revealed that no login activity was logged.

### 7. **What is the name of the infected host on which suspicious PowerShell commands were executed?**
**Answer:** James.browne  
- **Steps Taken:**  
  - I used the search results showing the creation of the new user and traced it to a command that was executed via PowerShell. By examining the details under the "hostname" field, I found the infected host name to be **James.browne**.

### 8. **PowerShell logging is enabled on this device. How many events were logged for the malicious PowerShell execution?**
**Answer:** 79  
- **Steps Taken:**  
  - I used the search query `index=main Powershell EventID=4103` to find PowerShell execution logs. In Splunk, event ID 4103 is for PowerShell logging. I found that **79** events were logged for malicious PowerShell executions.

### 9. **An encoded PowerShell script from the infected host initiated a web request. What is the full URL?**
**Answer:** `http://10.10.10.5/news.php`  
- **Steps Taken:**  
  - Using the information from the PowerShell logs, I decoded the encoded PowerShell script using CyberChef. The decoded URL used by the infected host to initiate the web request was:  
`http://10.10.10.5/news.php`

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used  
- **Splunk:** For analyzing and investigating logs from the infected hosts.  
- **CyberChef:** For decoding the base64-encoded PowerShell script and extracting the URL.  
- **PowerShell Logs:** For identifying malicious commands executed via PowerShell.  
- **Event Logs:** To track user creation, registry changes, and other suspicious activities.

## üß† Key Takeaways  
- Splunk is an invaluable tool for ingesting, analyzing, and searching large volumes of log data to identify potential threats.  
- Understanding event IDs and how they relate to different system activities (like user creation or registry modifications) is crucial for incident investigation.  
- PowerShell is often used for malicious activities in Windows environments, so logging and monitoring PowerShell events is essential for identifying suspicious behavior.
