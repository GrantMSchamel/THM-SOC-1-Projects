# Snapped Phish-ing Line - Portfolio Project

## Introduction: Phishing Campaign Investigation  
As an IT personnel for SwiftSpend Financial, I was tasked with investigating a widespread phishing campaign targeting employees. Several employees reported receiving suspicious emails, and some had already submitted their credentials to the phishing page. My responsibilities included analyzing the emails, investigating the phishing URLs, retrieving and dissecting the phishing kit, and leveraging Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) tools to gather more information about the adversary.  

This project highlights my ability to investigate phishing campaigns and secure an organization against credential theft.
