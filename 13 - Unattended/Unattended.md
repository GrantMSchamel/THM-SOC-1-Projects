# Unattended - Portfolio Project  

## Introduction  
Welcome to my investigation of a potential data exfiltration incident. The scenario involves a suspicious janitor spotted near an employee's office, raising concerns about unauthorized user activity during the employee's absence. My task was to uncover any unauthorized access or file exfiltration that occurred between **12:05 PM to 12:45 PM on November 19, 2022**.  

The investigation utilized disk image analysis and specialized tools provided on the system. Confidentiality was maintained throughout, adhering to strict NDA requirements.
