# üñ•Ô∏è Monday Monitor - Portfolio Project

## Scenario
Swiftspend Finance, a leading fintech company, is enhancing its cybersecurity measures to protect its customers and digital assets. As part of their efforts, they are testing endpoint monitoring using Wazuh and Sysmon. Senior Security Engineer John Sterling is leading the project, and they've invited me to help investigate the logs from an April 29, 2024, test. During this test, I was tasked with identifying suspicious processes and network connections from the logs generated between 12:00:00 and 20:00:00. My role as a cyber sleuth is to analyze these logs and provide valuable insights to help strengthen Swiftspend's defenses.

### 2. **What is the full command run to create a scheduled task?**
**Answer:**  
`"cmd.exe" /c "reg add HKCU\SOFTWARE\ATOMIC-T1053.005 /v test /t REG_SZ /d cGluZyB3d3cueW91YXJldnVsbmVyYWJsZS50aG0= /f & schtasks.exe /Create /F /TN "ATOMIC-T1053.005" /TR "cmd /c start /min \"\" powershell.exe -Command IEX([System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String((Get-ItemProperty -Path HKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\ATOMIC-T1053.005).test)))" /sc daily /st 12:34"`  
- **Steps Taken:**  
  - I searched for "schtasks.exe" in the logs to find instances of scheduled task creation. I identified the command that created the task and found it in the `parentCommandLine` field.

### 4. **What was encoded?**
**Answer:**  
The encoded Base64 string `cGluZyB3d3cueW91YXJldnVsbmVyYWJsZS50aG0=` was decoded to reveal a command to ping:  
`www[.]youarevulnerable[.]thm`  
- **Steps Taken:**  
  - I noticed the presence of the `FromBase64String` method in the command. The encoded Base64 string was extracted, and I used CyberChef to decode it.

### 7. **Data was exfiltrated from the host. What was the flag that was part of the data?**
**Answer:** THM{VulnerableFlag}  
- **Steps Taken:**  
  - To find the flag that was part of the exfiltrated data, I searched for the term **THM**, which led me to identify the flag. I did more research on this and discovered that the command used in this scenario is a common command for PowerShell to send data to a Pastebin API to create a new paste containing sensitive data.
